# PokemonGame
 
Turn-based game in the console. (Sth similar to Pokemon game)
Player chooses their team out of 15 monsters and fight with computer's team.
Game has 4-6 round each with 4-6 enemy's monster to defeat.

Each moster has special ability like shild, poison, revive, summon etc.
Abilities are passive or active and may have inf. or finitly many use.

There are 6 elements : Water, Earth, Air, Fire, Ice, Steel.
Table strong-weak effectiveness egains each other can be found in listed below pdf.

Enemy's behavior is random but enemy won't try attacking moster which is already dead etc.
Better combat AI may be provided soon if I have time (like attacing most dangerous monsters first or trying to finish off low-hp ones).

I have to say some monsters (especially it's abilities) are stronger then others but still game ballanse is good enough to be fun to play.
And even if you choose the strongers monster, winning whole game on hard is difficult since you don't heal every round.


Saving and loading is supported.

This game is my firt project for C++ classes in my univercity. 
Detailed description can be found in Turn-based-Game.pdf

This project is finished and was graded with maximum score. But I may upgrade it a bit since there are some stuff which I'd like to change.
